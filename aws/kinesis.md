# Amazon Kinesis

## Streaming Data Overview

High volume data produced continuously from a large variety of sources at a high velocity:

* Mobile apps
* Metering records 
* Web clickstream
* IoT sensors 
* Application logs
* Smart building 

_Challenges of data streaming:_

* Difficult to setup
* Hard to achieve high availability
* Error prone and complex to manage
* Tricky to scale
* Integration requires development
* Expensive to maintain

## Introduction to Amazon Kinesis

Kinesis tools: 1. _Kinesis Data Streams_. Collect and store data streams for analytics 2. _Kinesis Data Firehose_. Load data streams into AWS data stores 3. _Kinesis Data Analytics_. Analyse data stream with SQL or Java 4. _Kinesis Video Streams_. Capture and store video streams for analytics

_Benefits of Kinesis for Streaming:_ 1. No infrastructure provisioning, no management 2. Automatically scales during re-shard operations 3. No stream consumptions costs when no new records to process 4. Hight availability and secure

_Streaming Ingestion:_ 1. AWS Toolkits/Libraries: 1. AWS SDK 2. Kinesis Producer Library 3. AWS Mobile SDK 4. Kinesis Agent 2. AWS Services Integrations: 1. AWS IoT 2. Amazon CloudWatch. Events and Logs 3. Amazon Database. Migration services 3. 3rd party Offerings: 1. LOG4J 2. Flume 3. Fluentd

_Streaming Processing:_ 1. Kinesis: 1. SQL 2. Flink 3. Kinesis Client Library + Connection Library 2. AWS Services 1. AWS Lambda 2. Amazon EMR 3. 3rd party offering: 1. Spark Streaming 2. Storm 3. MongoDB 4. Splunk 5. â€¦

_Create Kinesis Stream_

* Kinesis stream name
  * Number of shard
  * Total stream capacity 

### Kinesis Data Stream: Standard consumers

Beware poison messages

* Lambda checkpoints upon the success of each batch.
* Failed batches are retried indefinitely \(until the bad record expires from the shard\) 

![KDS](../.gitbook/assets/kinesis-03.png)

* Catch exceptions and log for online analysis

Note: Kinesis data is base64 encoded so need to decode

Kinesis Data Streams: Enhanced fan-out consumers

* Consumers do not pull. Messages are pushed to the consumer as they arrive. ![KDS](../.gitbook/assets/kinesis-05.png)
* Each consumer app gets dedicated 2MB per second egress, per shard. ![KDS](../.gitbook/assets/kinesis-06.png)

Create Kinesis Consumer

* Register consumer with the CLI
* Kinesis trigger:
  * Kinesis stream name
  * Consumer 
  * Batch size
  * Starting position 

When to use standard consumers:

* Total number of consuming appositions is low \(&lt;3\)
* Consumers are not latency-sensitive
* Minimize cost

When to use enhanced fan-out consumers:

* Multiple consumer apps for the same Kinesis Data Stream
  * Default limit of 5 registered consuming apps
  * More can be supported with a service limit increase request.
* Low-latency requirements for data processing
  * Messages are typically delivered to a consumer in less than 70 ms

## Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

Persistence layer store options:

* Amazon S3
* Amazon Redshift
* Amazon Elasticsearch Service 
* Splunk

Kinesis Data Firehose features:

* Enrich streaming data
* Filter streaming data
* Convert streaming data
* Record format conversion. 

Note: Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can convert data using columnar schema: Parquet or ORC.

* Source Record S3 Backup
  * Raw data backup to your DataLake
  * You can filter, enrich, and convert records while maintaining the raw incoming records

Serverless Data Lake Ingestion Architecture

* Kinesis Data Firehose conversion, aggregation, and persistence to you Data Lake

## Data schemas

* \[Amazon Kinesis Analytics can now discover data schemas from sample S3 objects, Posted On: Oct 4, 2017\]\(

_How does Kinesis support Avro?_

Separately, writing lots of little Avro files, each with their own schema, for "gluing records together" in Kinesis is certainly not a very good use of storage space, so I think the Kinesis model combined with Avro isn't the right choice here.
