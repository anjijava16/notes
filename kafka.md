## kafkacat Utility

kafkacat is a command line utility that you can use to test and debug Apache Kafka® deployments. You can use kafkacat to produce, consume, and list topic and partition information for Kafka. Described as “netcat for Kafka”, it is a swiss-army knife of tools for inspecting and creating data in Kafka.

It is similar to Kafka Console Producer \(**kafka-console-producer**\) and Kafka Console Consumer \(**kafka-console-consumer**\), but even more powerful.
